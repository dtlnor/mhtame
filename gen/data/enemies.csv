Goliath Squids use special luminescent organs to light up their whole body, scaring off enemies and hunting prey. Some believe it might also be a way for them to communicate with each other.

Great Trevally are diurnal and have a wide range of habitats. Smaller specimens can even be found in the shallows. They show a strong interest in Tuff Joint Bait.","",INVALID,INVALID,ITEM_0013,INVALID,A0083,I_MOS

Their numerous tentacles draw in and catch prey. Escunites move by expelling water from organs called siphons that are hidden inside their tentacles.

Several theories have been put forward as to why this happens: a mutation, or a defensive measure to better blend into surroundings. However, until more specimens are collected and research conducted, it will remain as speculation.

The plating is not part of their biology but rather a collection of scavenged materials. Because of the similar fin shapes, some believe these are actually female Virid Bowfins in their breeding period. However, not enough specimens have been found or studied to shed light on these theories.
